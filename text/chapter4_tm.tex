\section{Erythropoesis as a well-characterised model system}

Because of the relative sparsity of well characterised MLL-r specific enhancers, we choose to first model a differentiation system which has been well characterised. Erythropoesis is the process by which hematopoetic stem cells first differentiate into progenitor populations before committing to the myeloid lineage and eventually undergoing enucleation and terminal differentition into mature erythrocytes. This system has been extensively studied (cite Ludwig and Corces and the protein one) and a catelog of differentially active transcription factors and associated enhancer elements can be readily derived from the literature. We seek to validate the proposed topic modelling approach on this model system by systematically building up a model of erythropoesis, including sequentially various detractor lineages such as a related differentiation to B cell lymphopoesis, asking whether topics are able to reproducibly recapitulate known dynamics of lineage committment and terminal differentiation. 


\begin{enumerate}
    \item Talk about other tools for performing this task and how this is not actually the same question. We need to be able to differentiate between arbitrary number of cells and cell states, not limited to just lookign at systems where the full differentiaiton hierarchy is available. 
    \item Talk about the methods for fidning these differentially accessible elements between the different stages. 
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Data preperation and peak calling}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Where was the data downloaded from? How was it processed?
    \item Peak calling. MaCS3 versus lance-o-tron. What kind of diagnostic features can we see here? 
    \item Number of peaks. 
    \item Peak length distribution
\end{enumerate}
